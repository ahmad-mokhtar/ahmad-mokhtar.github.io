  - title: Introduction to Intersection Theory
    speaker: Chi Ki Ngai
    time: Thu June 1 13:30
    location: K9509
    abstract: |
      Intersection theory concerns about the invariance of intersection of subvarieties under some equivalence relation, for example, Bézout's theorem states that the number of intersection of two plane curves only depends on their degree, and another example is that there is 27 lines on any smooth cubic surface in P^3. In this talk, we will be discussing about rational equivalence, Chow ring, and we will use affine stratification to compute the Chow ring of some simple variety like P^n and P^m×P^n, and then we will use it to give some results. If time allows, we may talk a bit about Chern classes.

  - title: Introduction to Tropical algebraic geometry
    speaker: Leonardo Montoya
    time: Thu May 11 13:30
    location: K9509
    abstract: |
      We will define the tropical semiring and see how tropical arithmetic turns polynomials into piecewise linear functions. We will later define tropical hypersurface and the tropicalization of an algebraic hypersurface. Armed with that knowledge we will present the connection between tropical and algebraic geometry, given by the fundamental theorem of tropical algebraic geometry, and finally will then define the tropicalization of an algebraic variety and give a sneak into what information about the variety we can recover from its tropicalization.

  - title: The Tate-Shafarevich group
    speaker: Emiel Haakma
    time: Thu Mar 30 13:30
    location: K9509
    abstract: |
      In this talk, I will discuss the definition and motivation behind the mysterious Tate-Shafarevich group, relating to the number of rational points on algebraic curves. Should time allow, I will also share a plan of attack to prove various facts about this group, which does not allow straightforward proofs.

  - title: 27 lines on smooth cubic surfaces
    speaker: Zhe Xu
    time: Thu Mar 23 13:30
    location: AQ5009
    abstract: |
      In 1849 Arthur Caley and George Salmon proved that there are exactly 27 lines on each cubic smooth surface over an algebraically closed field. In this talk, I will present a modern construction of the arguments to prove this result. We will show that the lines lie on a smooth cubic surface is the vanishing locus of a section of the 3rd symmetric power of the tautological bundle on the Grassmannian of lines in P^3. Towards this goal, we will briefly introduce the Chern classes as degeneracy loci of the general sections, the Schubert cycles, and the Chow Ring.
