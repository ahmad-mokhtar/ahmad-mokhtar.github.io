I am a mathematics instructor at Capilano University and a sessional instructor at <a href='https://www.sfu.ca/math.html'>Simon Fraser University</a>.

I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics (Algebraic Geometry) from Simon Fraser University. I am interested in Fano schemes (which parametrize linear spaces on varieties), toric geometry, toric degenerations and computational algebraic geometry. My Ph.D. advisor was <a href='https://www.sfu.ca/~nilten/'>Nathan Ilten</a>. Here is my full <a href="{{ '/cv/' | relative_url }}">CV</a>.

I co-organized the SFU graduate student seminar in number theory and algebraic geometry (<a href="{{ '/gradieNTAG/' | relative_url }}">gradieNTAG</a>) together with <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/sharon-robins'>Sharon Robins</a> and Pijush Sarmah.

In my free time I like to read books, hike and ice skate. One of the craziest hikes I have done is the <a href='https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=statlu+and+brotherhood+lake+trailhead'>Statlu and Brotherhood lake trail</a> in Fraser Valley, BC, Canada. The roundtrip to the upper lake took eleven hours.
